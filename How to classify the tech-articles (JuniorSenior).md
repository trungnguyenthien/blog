# How to classify the tech-articles (Junior/Senior)

#### It's just my thought.

Actually, I followed these criterias to classify developer's level.

If I explain my idea base on Bloom’s Taxonomy. Junior is 3 low-levels, Senior is 3 high-levels. 

```
(*) For classifying developer level, I appreciate the origin "Bloom’s Taxonomy" (1956) than the optimization version (2000).

Consider, there is developer has a knowledge of several tools, techniques. Some of them are lesser-known tools. He can apply them in his project. However, when he is asked making a choice between tools (that has the similar functions) for specific requirement, he can't decide (because, he lack analysis, evaluation capacity) ==> to me, he is a smart, excellent Junior developer.

In my opinion, the Senior's standard is:

* Analysis, Evaluation, "Make a choice" capacity.
* Has flexible solution.
* Has vision of product's value (better than executable code)

I fully understand the difficult of applying my thought to recruiting and promotion in Vietnam. 

**But at least, Can I try it to classify Tech-articles?**

Don't be afraid of there are someone's opinion (flip side opinion). This is your experience, did you try it on your real project? Did you get your teamate's encourage? In other hand, the flip side opinion may be a good advise to fullfill your knowledge.
